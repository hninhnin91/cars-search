# cars-search (python)

Project Overview:

Developed a next-generation AI-powered car search engine that caters to the growing demands of the digital e-commerce landscape. This system empowers users with a flexible and reliable search experience, allowing them to find the information they need through keywords or image uploads.

Key Features:

Dual Search Mode: Users can search for cars using either keywords (e.g., brand, model, year) or by uploading images (various car views and angles).

NLP-powered Keyword Search: Employs the state-of-the-art BERT pre-trained model, known for its superior language understanding capabilities, to extract relevant information from user queries and deliver highly accurate search results.

Deep Learning-based Image Search: Leverages multiple Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs), including VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, to efficiently identify car models from uploaded images. VGG16 demonstrated the highest accuracy in identifying car models from images.

API-driven User Interface: Utilizes Flask APIs to establish a seamless user interface for keyword and image search, facilitating smooth interaction with the search engine and retrieval of desired car information.
